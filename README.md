# QwtWaterfallplot
A waterfall plot powered with Qwt for Qt/C++ applications.

Interesting features :
- Vertical axis's (time) labels are falling with waterfall layers.
- Projection of the vertical and horizontal layer on two curves of a particular point of the waterfall.
- Color rescaling as data is preserved (no QImage is used) and colors are computed with each replot.
